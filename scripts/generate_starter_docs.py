Start by mastering Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. Take online courses on machine learning fundamentals from NPTEL or Coursera. Build 3-4 portfolio projects: predictive modeling, image classification, and NLP tasks. Participate in Kaggle competitions to gain practical experience. Learn cloud ML platforms like AWS SageMaker or Google Vertex AI. The key advantage for software engineers is existing coding skills and system design knowledge. Focus on understanding ML algorithms deeply rather than just using libraries. In 2026, Indian companies prioritize engineers who can deploy ML models to production, not just build notebooks. Expected salary jump: 30-50% if transitioning with 3+ years experience. Cities with most opportunities: Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, NCR. Certification from Andrew Ng's ML course or fast.ai adds credibility. Join ML communities like Bangalore ML or Data Science Pune for networking.",
